Answers by: Michael Meldrum

1. How many files are in /usr/bin directory?

	command: ls -1 /usr/bin | wc -l

	answer: 626

2. Identify the server process with the highest memory usage.

	command: top (used '>' for appropriate filtering)
	
	answer:

	PID	USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES	SHR  S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND 
	697	whoopsie  20  0	  622m 	251m	580  S  0.0 51.5   1:53.23 whoopsie           
	21819	meldru20  20  0   26208 7148 	1384 S  0.0  1.4   0:01.09 bash  

	Above are the two server processes with the top memory usage. Clearly the process 'whoopsie' is the highest.

3. What is your server's timezone?

	command: date

	answer: UTC-0

4. How many default groups does your Ubuntu distribution have?

	command: cat /etc/group | wc -l

	answer: The number output was 57. This represents all of the groups. To get the number of default groups I
		just need to subtract the groups I added from this number. I have added 5 groups so the number of
		default groups would be 52.

5. Download, un-tar and execute the following PHP file () from the command line on your server. What is the output? Bonus: Name the sequence!

	what I did: Installed and used ftp on server to get the file on my server. Un-tar'd the file with: tar -xvwf 362.tar
			Ran the php with: php 362.php (after installing php5 on the server)

	output: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181
		This is the Fibonacci sequence.



PS. This was actually quite fun!
